hello world

Day 'n' nite
I toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace but see I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play...play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first, but surely finish last, last
